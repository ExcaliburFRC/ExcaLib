## üöÄ What is This Repository?

This repository contains the source code and releases for **ExcaLib**, a Java-based library built on top of WPILib to streamline robot development for **FRC** teams.

ExcaLib is designed to:
- Accelerate development with prebuilt, plug-and-play mechanisms
- Enable teams to focus on **robot behavior** and **strategy**, not boilerplate
- Encourage **best practices** in code structure, testing, and reusability
- Provide high-level control abstractions (PID, motion profiling, trapezoids, feedforward, state-space, and more)
- Seamlessly integrate with WPILib's command-based architecture

## üìö Documentation

üìñ Full docs are available at:  
[**excalib.excaliburfrc.com/docs**](https://excalib.excaliburfrc.com/docs)  

> [!NOTE]
> ExcaLib is designed to complement WPILib, not replace it. We recommend familiarizing yourself with WPILib concepts before diving into ExcaLib to better understand the foundations.

## üì¶ Installation

### Adding ExcaLib to Your Project

ExcaLib is available as a WPILib **vendor dependency**. To install:

1. Open your robot project in your code editor.
2. Open the WPILib Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or click the WPILib icon)
3. Select `Manage Vendor Libraries`
4. Select `Install new libraries (online)`
5. Paste the following JSON URL when prompted:

```yml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExcaliburFRC/ExcaLib/pre-release/ExcaLib.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For further guidance, refer to the [WPILib Vendor Library Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html).
>
> You **MUST** install the [`Monologue`](https://github.com/shueja/monologue) library alongside ExcaLib.  
> Monologue enables annotation-based telemetry and logging, which is used extensively throughout ExcaLib.
